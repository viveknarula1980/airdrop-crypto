   - Choose "Add Network" to open the settings for adding a new network.

3. ENTER SEPOLIA TESTNET DETAILS:
   In the custom network configuration page, you'll need to input the following details for Sepolia:

   - Network Name: Sepolia Testnet
   - New RPC URL: https://sepolia.optimism.io/
   - Chain ID: 11155420
   - Currency Symbol: ETH
   - Block Explorer URL: https://optimism-sepolia.blockscout.com


4. Save the Network: Once all the details are entered, click Save.
